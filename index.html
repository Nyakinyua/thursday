<h1>THURSDAY BEGINS</h1>

    <p>If you were to ask me, Thursdays are one of the most under appreciated days of the week. You’re more than halfway through the work week and you’re so close to Friday you can almost taste it.

            So why doesn’t Thursday get all the love it deserves? It probably because it’s just that…Thursday. There are rarely interesting happenings that take place on Thursdays, so it tends to fall to the wayside and almost go unnoticed among the other exciting days of the week.
            
            What do you say? Think we should show it some more love?
